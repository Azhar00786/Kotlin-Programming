* When we write var data: Int = 0 in Koltin, we create a property. 
* And Getters and Setters are called in the background when we try to change the value of the property. We can set the value of data by className.data = anyIntValue & get the value of the data by className.data.

* 	class Animal{
		var age: Int = 0
			get() = field		//field is implicitly define variable that we can use only in getter and setter, It is use to access the actual value of the age property.
			set(value){			//value is the new value that is given to the property.
				if(value >= 0){
					field = value		
				}
			}
	}
