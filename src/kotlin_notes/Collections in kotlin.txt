*Array
	
	* Array is a container for multiple elements.
    	* General rule of thump is, you can use array if you know how many elements you have and that number is not gonna change.
    	* Array are very useful to loop over. 
	* you require a loop to print all values of an array
	
	example: val array = arrayOf("Texas","Iowa","California")
	
	
* List
	* General rule of thump is, you can use List if you know how many elements you have and that number is not gonna change.
	
	* example: val list = listOf("orange","Apple","Banana")
	
	* The above example creates a immutable list, so you can't change the contents of it.

	* You can print all values of an List using: println(listName)
	
* ArrayList
	* Inorder to change the data as you like you can create ArrayList.
	* It basically combines arrays and list.
	* It a list that internally stores the elements in an Array and it resizes the array if necessary.
	
	example: val arraylist = arrayListOf("Patrick","Michael","Sarah")
			 arraylist.add("Sandra")
