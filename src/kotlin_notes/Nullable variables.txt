* Null basically represents missing reference
* Inorder to create a null variable in Kotlin we have to use '?'
		var str:String?  = null
* if we try to use length method on above example like str.length we will get an error.
* In order to use length method on str we have to do a safe call 
		str?.length
 this will give us the result.
* We can assure Kotlin that the processed value will not be null, for that
		str!!.length
* If we put str = 0 and then use str!!.length then Compiler will throw NullPointerException.
